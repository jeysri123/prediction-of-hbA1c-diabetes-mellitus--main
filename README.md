# 🧬 HbA1c Diabetes Prediction

This is a Machine Learning-based web application designed to **predict the risk of Diabetes Mellitus** using patient health data, particularly focusing on **HbA1c levels** and other diagnostic inputs.



---

## 📌 Features

- Predicts whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic based on input parameters.
- Uses a trained ML model for accurate HbA1c-based prediction.
- Interactive form-based web UI using Flask.
- Provides preventive alerts based on prediction result.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  
- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **ML Model:** Logistic Regression / Random Forest / Decision Tree  
- **Deployment:** Render / Localhost  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User inputs medical values:
   - Age
   - Blood Pressure
   - Glucose Level
   - BMI
   - HbA1c Level
   - Insulin Level
   - Diabetes Pedigree Function
   - etc.

2. Model analyzes the data and predicts:
   - **0**: Non-Diabetic  
   - **1**: Diabetic

3. Instant feedback is provided with basic health suggestions.

📊 Dataset
The model is trained using HbA1c-based Diabetes Dataset sourced from Kaggle / UCI Repository.

Preprocessed and split into training and testing sets with proper scaling.
